Note the Workspace has been set up for you to have 2022 code, CTRE example and our 2020/21 code in it, see projects in the workspace on the left
Things to do in 2022 code
1) Rename Launch Ball and/or Stop Launcher to have a consistent naming system. eg SpinLauncher StopLauncher
2) add StopLauncher to Robot Container as a button
Look in the 2020 Lakerbots code for how to use a solenoid to make methods to extend and retract the hoodAngle cylinder
3) Make the methods in the launcher subsytem to extend and retract the hoodAngle

read https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/hardware-apis/pneumatics/pneumatics.html#generating-and-storing-pressure
4) and then add compressor.enableDigital(); in the pneumatics subsystem

copy all of it into our program and then fix it when it breaks. eg , put each section in its own place (new methods vs constructors etc. constants class)

Work with electrical to make sure talons CAN ID's are correct and firmware is updated.

make launcher tune the default command of the subsystemx1`

copy the launcher tune for the climbers except make it climber tune

Review changes to how robotcontainer commands are linked to buttons


Start on Swerve Drive

Make sure we do not have any conflicting CAN ids with swerve drivetrain.
Make command for driving (default command)

2/5
Arrange commands into packages
Try and add other joystick
Add new subystem (Hopper) with one TalonSRX, take intakefollow and put it into hopper
Add digital input to detect ball (look in 2020 code(elevator subsytem))

add second hopper motor to hopper subsystem A,B
Create tune hopper command
add tunehopper to robot container as default command of subsytem
 -done
in hopper subsystem for each hopperA,B

create hopper set position method-done

create hopper reset encoder method - done

create hopper set speed method-done

create hopper set power method - done

creare hopper get position method - assumed done

do this - done
